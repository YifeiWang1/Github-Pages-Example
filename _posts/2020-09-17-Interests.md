My current research interests include financial markets, spacial econometrics, future prediction, machine learning, system dynamics, and nonlinear systems.<br>
<br>
<b>1, Asset pricing</b> <br>
---Use <b>economic and statistical methods</b> to find out effective indexes which influence price movement<br>
---Use <b>interdisciplinary approaches</b> to predict future asset prices or stock market movements<br>
<br>
<b>2, Future prediction</b><br>
---Apply machine learning techniques to do future prediction; implement with <b>Python</b><br>
---Use <b>Eviews</b>  to predict the future movement of time series data<br>
<br>
<b>3，System dynamics</b><br>
---use system dynamics method to capture the <b>nonlinear and feedback</b>  relationship within the system<br>
---Applications in financial markets, health systems, and environmental systems<br>
---Observe how <b>complex systems</b> change over time<br>
---Better prevent side effects<br>
---Combine with <b>agent-based model</b>  to achieve accurate intervention<br>
<br>
<b>4，Machine learning</b><br>
---Predict future<br>
---<b>Combined</b> with system dynamics(serve as each other’s imput) to solve more problems<br>
<br>
<b>5，Spacial econometrics</b><br>
---Cross-regional, dynamic, systematic research<br>
---Interesting and viable under the availability of big data.<br>
