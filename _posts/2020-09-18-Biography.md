I was born in Changchun, Jilin, China, June 12, 1998. Majoring in finance and minoring in management, I got my bachelor's degree in economics(Finance) in 2020.07 from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics. During my undergraduate period, I have done research in several fields including system dynamics, asset pricing, machine leaning, algorithm, and econometrics to find out where my interest locates. My research goal in the future is to resolve more challenging problems from an interdisciplinary perspective.
