Person-in-charge					  Advisor: Prof. Weizhong Hou<br>
Applied the Armington model in the paper<br>
Concluded that the trade war was not beneficial to either country's economy, and it means more from a political aspect<br>



<b>Research on Accurate Intervention in the Development of Diabetes by Targeting Heterogeneous Agents          2018.01-2018.06</b><br>
Main Participant	                        Advisor: Prof. Shiyong Liu & Cheng Xu<br>
Applied the agent-based technique to deal with the heterogeneity in our target patient groups in order to achieve accurate intervention.<br>
Adopted different kinds of disease intervention policies to make precise intervention according to different agent groups<br>




<b>Evaluating the Impact of Transportation Infrastructure on Agricultural Output in China                      2017.06-2017.12</b><br>
Participant					           Advisor: Prof. Han Li<br>
Studied the impact of transportation facilities on agricultural economy<br>
Used Brick Agriculture Database to collect data of each province<br>
Concluded that convenient and efficient agricultural transportation and transactions brought by transportation facilities would reduce the total cost in the agricultural economic chain and increase disposable income, which would increase agricultural investment and the utilization rate of land per unit, making up for the negative impact on the occupation of arable land<br>
