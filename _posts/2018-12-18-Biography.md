I was born in Hefei, Anhui, China, August 27, 1996. I am currently a junior undergraduate student majoring in Electronics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. As an undergraduate student, I have done research in several fields including high-efficiency RF power amplifiers, microwave filters, theory of graphene and its applications in electronic devices in order to find where my interest locates. My research goal in future is to resolve more challenging problems both in THz, RF, and power electronics circuits and systems from interdisciplinary perspective.
