<h2>Research Experiences</h2>






<b>● Maverick Stock Capturing Strategy Ensembled with Hybrid Machine Learning Techniques</b><br>
<b>2020.07-Present; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Author; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advisor: Prof. Jun Wang</b><br>
---Applied machine learning techniques to improve a maverick stock capturing strategy<br>
---Applied Attention-based BERT to extract data features, as well as Naïve Bayesian, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest and their ensembled model based on voting to train and fit the model<br>
---Tensor fusion are applied to merge data<br>
---Concluded that the improved strategy is much more effective than the original trading strategy, and is likely to behave even better during market downturn<br>
<br>


<b>● Heart Disease Prediction by Using Hybrid Machine Learning Techniques</b><br>
<b>2020.07-Present; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Participant; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advisor: Prof. Shiyong Liu</b><br>
---Predicted future occurrence of heart disease using machine learning techniques<br> 
---Collected Big data related to population characteristics (such as region, height, weight, basic diseases, etc.)<br>
---Responsible for machine learning model constructing and coding<br>
<br>

<b>● An Integrated Analysis Over Environmental Impact and Economic Opportunities of Express Delivery Waste from Online Shopping </b><br> 
<b>2020.06-Present; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Author; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advisor: Prof. Shiyong Liu</b><br>
---Comprehensively considered the overall cost (including environmental cost, clearance cost, land occupation cost, etc.) and related economic benefits (such as jobs created, GDP contribution, etc.) of online shopping express waste<br> 
----Applied system dynamics technique to figure out the equilibrium of future development direction in order to balance the environmental losses and economic benefits<br> 
<br>

<b>● Application of Dynamic Programming on Intellectual Test Paper Design," 2020 International Conference on Machine Learning and Computer Application (Accepted)</b><br>
<b>2020.06-2020.09; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Author; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><br>
---Applied dynamic programming algorithm to realize an intellectual paper construction system<br>
---Optimized the space complexity and the compared time and space complexity with greedy and brute force algorithm<br>
<br>
  
<b>● An Application of System Dynamics to Study the Impact of Fossil Fuel Transportation Emissions on Local Air Quality in Beijing</b><br>
<b>2020.01-Present; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Author; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advisor: Prof. Shiyong Liu</b><br>
---Applied system dynamics techniques to evaluate the influence of fossil fuel transportation on air pollution level<br>
---Constructed different policy combinations and done simulations to figure out the most effective way on reducing air pollution<br>
<br>

<b>● Evaluating the Impact of President’s Election on Exchange Rate’s Fluctuation</b><br>
<b>2018.09-2018.12; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Person-in-charge; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advisor: Prof. Ji Wu</b><br> 
---Applied event Study method to study the impact of president election on exchange rate<br> 
---Conducted emotional analysis based on data obtained from relevant forums.<br> 
<br>


<b>● Will the China-US Trade War Benefits US?</b><br>
<b>2018.07-2018.09; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Person-in-charge; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advisor: Prof. Weizhong Hou</b><br>
---Applied the Armington model in the paper<br>
---Concluded that the trade war was not beneficial to either country's economy, and it means more from a political aspect<br>
<br>


<b>● Research on Accurate Intervention in the Development of Diabetes by Targeting Heterogeneous Agents</b><br>
<b>2018.01-2018.06; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Participant; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advisor: Prof. Shiyong Liu & Cheng Xu</b><br>
---Applied the agent-based technique to deal with the heterogeneity in our target patient groups in order to achieve accurate intervention.<br>
---Adopted different kinds of disease intervention policies to make precise intervention according to different agent groups<br>
<br>



<b>● Evaluating the Impact of Transportation Infrastructure on Agricultural Output in China</b><br>
<b>2017.06-2017.12; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advisor: Prof. Han Li</b><br>
---Studied the impact of transportation facilities on agricultural economy<br>
---Used Brick Agriculture Database to collect data of each province<br>
---Concluded that convenient and efficient agricultural transportation and transactions brought by transportation facilities would reduce the total cost in the agricultural economic chain and increase disposable income, which would increase agricultural investment and the utilization rate of land per unit, making up for the negative impact on the occupation of arable land<br>
