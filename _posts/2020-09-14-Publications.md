---Proposed a new extraction model based on improved Deeplabv3+ network<br>
---Compared with the selected U-Net, SegNet, FCN, and PSPNet, the improved Deeplabv3+ model has increased 3.893%, 5.242%, 4.318%，3.471% on PA, and 6.534%, 3.732%，3.749%，6.331% on IOU,and 6.111%, 6.698%, 5.776%，4.901% on Recall. At the same time, the extraction result also reduces noise, enhances the integrity of the extracted water body and the edge refinement ability, and has good practicability.<br>

<h2>Paper under review</h2>

<b>● Yifei Wang</b>, Meiling Jin, Chunyan Zhu, Mingshan Lu. <b>Impact of Air Quality on COVID-19 Confirmed and Death Cases: Evidence from China.</b> (Under Review)<br>
---This study examines the impact of the air quality index (AQI) on daily COVID-19 cases and deaths in prefecture-level cities in China from January 22, 2020, to March 20, 2020. We find significant evidence for air quality index (AQI) to impact daily confirmed COVID-19 cases positively. By further decomposing AQI to its components, we find a significant positive impact from SO2, NO2, O3, and CO on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. Results also show a positively significant impact from PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO on daily dead COVID-19 cases. <br>

● Xuan Wu, Silong Zhou, Mingwei Chen , Yihang Zhao, <b>Yifei Wang</b>, Xianmeng Zhao, Danyang Li, Haibo Pu. <b>Combined Spectral and Speech Features for Pig Speech Recognition.</b> (Submitted)<br>
---A fusion network idea is proposed to better recognize speech of pigs through the mutual complementation of spectral features and audio features. In the spectral features section, chroma, spectral contrast, tonnetz, MFCC, and LM features are extracted and combined to obtain MC, LC, and MLMC features, a total of eight different features to ensure the diversity of features and the robustness of the model. We design a parallel network structure and supplement the input spectrum and audio features of the model, which gives us an accuracy score of 93.39%. 

<h2>Working Paper</h2>

<b>● Yifei Wang</b>, <b>Instrumental Variable Estimation of the Causal Effect of Childhood Sibship Size on Earnings in Adulthood: Evidence from the United States</b>(Expected to be contributed to Demography soon)<br>
---We use the instrument variable (IV) method to solve the endogenous problem in the current research.<br>
---We find sex discrimination within the American families, which is surprising, but don’t find an impact of sibship size on future earnings among female individuals.
