<h2>Publications</h2>
<b>● Yifei Wang</b> and Surong Wang, <b>Intelligent Test Paper Generation Based on Dynamic Programming Algorithm.</b> Journal of Physics: Conference Series. 1682, 012-023. Available from: DOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/1682/1/012023<br>
---Applied dynamic programming algorithm to realize an intellectual paper construction system<br>
---Optimized the space complexity and the compared time and space complexity with greedy and brute force algorithm<br>

<h2>Working Papers</h2>
<b>● Yifei Wang</b> and Jun Wang, <b>"Maverick Stock Capturing Strategy Ensembled with Hybrid Machine Learning Techniques,"</b> The Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems (Expected to contribute in June 2021)<br>
---Applied machine learning techniques to improve a maverick stock capturing strategy<br>
---Applied Attention-based BERT to extract data features, as well as Naïve Bayesian, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest and their ensembled model based on voting to train and fit the model<br>
--- Applied tensor fusion to merge data<br>
---Concluded that the improved strategy is much more effective than the original trading strategy, and is likely to behave even better during market downturn<br>
