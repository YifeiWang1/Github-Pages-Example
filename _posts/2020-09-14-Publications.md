<h2>Publications</h2>
<b>● Yifei Wang</b> and Surong Wang, <b>Intelligent Test Paper Generation Based on Dynamic Programming Algorithm.</b> Journal of Physics: Conference Series. 1682, 012-023. Available from: DOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/1682/1/012023<br>
---Applied dynamic programming algorithm to realize an intellectual paper construction system<br>
---Optimized the space complexity and the compared time and space complexity with greedy and brute force algorithm<br>
<br>
● Hongxiang Li, Ao Feng, Bin Lin, Houcheng Su, Zixi Liu, Xuliang Duan, <b>Yifei Wang</b>. (2021) <b>A novel method for credit scoring based on feature transformation and ensemble model. </b>PeerJ - Computer Science. <b> PeerJ Comput Sci.</b> 2021 Jun 4;7:e579. doi: 10.7717/peerj-cs.579. PMID: 34151000; PMCID: PMC8189024.<br>
---Proposed a prediction method based on feature transformation and ensembled model<br>
---Verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparative experiments on two standard data sets<br>
<br>
● Ao Feng, Hongxiang Li, Zixi Liu, <b>Yifei Wang</b>, Xuan Wu and Tao Liu, <b>Research on Water Extraction Model from Remote Sensing Image Based on Improved Deeplabv3+ Network.</b> Computer Technology and Development. <b>(Accepted)</b><br>
---Proposed a new extraction model based on improved Deeplabv3+ network<br>
---Compared with the selected U-Net, SegNet, FCN, and PSPNet, the improved Deeplabv3+ model has increased 3.893%, 5.242%, 4.318%，3.471% on PA, and 6.534%, 3.732%，3.749%，6.331% on IOU,and 6.111%, 6.698%, 5.776%，4.901% on Recall. At the same time, the extraction result also reduces noise, enhances the integrity of the extracted water body and the edge refinement ability, and has good practicability.<br>

<h2>Working Paper</h2>
<b>● Yifei Wang</b>, <b>Instrumental Variable Estimation of the Causal Effect of Childhood Sibship Size on Earnings in Adulthood: Evidence from the United States</b><br>
---We use the instrument variable (IV) method to solve the endogenous problem in the current research.<br>
---We find sex discrimination within the American families, which is surprising, but don’t find an impact of sibship size on future earnings among female individuals.<br>
<br>
<b>● Yifei Wang</b>, Mingshan Lu. <b>Impact of Air Quality on COVID-19 cases: Evidence from China.</b><br>
---This study examines the impact of the air quality index (AQI) on daily COVID-19 cases and deaths in prefecture-level cities in China from January 22, 2020, to March 20, 2020. We did not find clear evidence for AQI to impact COVID 19 cases except a 10% significant impact from AQI on confirmed case growth rate.<br>
