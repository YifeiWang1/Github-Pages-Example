<b>● Yifei Wang</b> and Surong Wang, <b>Intelligent Test Paper Generation Based on Dynamic Programming Algorithm.</b> Journal of Physics: Conference Series. 1682, 012-023. Available from: DOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/1682/1/012023<br>
---Applied dynamic programming algorithm to realize an intellectual paper construction system<br>
---Optimized the space complexity and the compared time and space complexity with greedy and brute force algorithm<br>
<br>
● Ao Feng, Hongxiang Li, Zixi Liu, <b>Yifei Wang</b>, Xuan Wu and Tao Liu, <b>Research on Water Extraction Model from Remote Sensing Image Based on Improved Deeplabv3+ Network.</b> Computer Technology and Development. <b>(Accepted)</b><br>
---proposed a new extraction model based on improved Deeplabv3+ network<br>
---Compared with the selected U-Net, SegNet, FCN, and PSPNet, the improved Deeplabv3+ model has increased 3.893%, 5.242%, 4.318%，3.471% on PA, and 6.534%, 3.732%，3.749%，6.331% on IOU,and 6.111%, 6.698%, 5.776%，4.901% on Recall. At the same time, the extraction result also reduces noise, enhances the integrity of the extracted water body and the edge refinement ability, and has good practicability.<br>

<h2>Working Papers</h2>
<b>● Yifei Wang</b> and Jun Wang, <b>"Maverick Stock Capturing Strategy Ensembled with Hybrid Machine Learning Techniques,"</b> <br>
---Applied machine learning techniques to improve a maverick stock capturing strategy<br>
---Applied Attention-based BERT to extract data features, as well as Naïve Bayesian, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest and their ensembled model based on voting to train and fit the model<br>
--- Applied tensor fusion to merge data<br>
---Concluded that the improved strategy is much more effective than the original trading strategy, and is likely to behave even better during market downturn<br>

<b>● Yifei Wang</b> and Shiyong Liu, <b>"An Application of System Dynamics to Study the Impact of Fossil Fuel Transportation Emissions on Local Air Quality in Beijing,"</b> <br>
---Applied system dynamics techniques to evaluate the influence of fossil fuel transportation on air pollution level<br>
---Constructed different policy combinations and done simulations to figure out the most effective way on reducing air pollution<br>
